										<h6>Second Purain City (AD 1123—AD 1142)</h6>
										<p align="justify">King Dathayarzar son of King Kawliya founded the second Purain city in AD 1123 which is located about four miles to the south-east of modern Mrauk-U town.

										<h6>Laung-Kyet City (AD 1251—AD 1406)</h6>
										<p align="justify">King Alaw-mar phyu who ascended the throne in AD 1250 moved the capital city from Narinsayar to Laung-kyet on the other side of Lemro river. Eighteen kings starting from King Alawmar-phyu to King Min Saw Mon ruled at Laung-kyet city for 155 years. In AD 1406 King Min Ye Kyaw~ Swar of Inwa (Ava) Kingdom attacked Laung-kyet city.

										<p align="justify">Mrauk- U historic city (20-25 N.Lat -93-11 E Long) is situated 40 miles to the north-east of Sittwe the capital city of Rakhine State in the western part of Myanmar. Mrauk - U ancient city was fortified by 30 Kilometer long fortification stone walls. In some parts stone fortification walls were connected with natural mountain ranges. These long fortification walls were surrounded with moats and canals. In some places natural ponds and lakes were used as natural barriers for the city. Mrauk-U is easily accessble by boat or by car from Sittwe. It takes about less than two hours by speed-boat, about four hours by normal boat and about five hours by car from Sittwe.</p>
										<p align="justify">Mrauk-U ancient city was located inside the elongated mountain ranges. Apart from natural mountain ranges, massive stone fortification walls were built to defend from the danger of military campaign from their rival Kingdoms. The view of Mrauk-U city as seen from above with the surrounding mountain ranges and encircling canals and moats makes the visitors spellbound. Mrauk-U city can be said as the strongest fortress city built in 1511, century A.D as evidenced by the remains of massive stone fortification walls and gate ways.</p>
										<p align="justify">Mrauk - U which remained as the capital of Rakhine Kingdom, was founded by King Min Saw Mori in AD 1430 . There were three Mrauk- U dynastic period. First Mrauk - U dynasty started with Min Saw Mon ( AD 1430-1433 ) and ended with Min Khaung Razar (AD 1521-1531 ). Twelve Kings ruled over the First Mrauk - U dynastic period. The Second Mrauk - U dynasty was started with King Min Bar Gyi (AD 1531-1553 ) and ended with King Min Sanai ( AD 1638, 20 days) . Nine Kings of the Second Mrauk - U dynasty ruled at Mrauk - U Kingdom. The third or the last Mrauk - U dynasty was ruled by twenty-seven Kings starting from King Kuthala - Narapatigyi ( AD 1638-1645 ) to King Mahathamada Razar ( AD 1782-1784 ) Altogether 48 Kings ruled over Mrauk - U Kingdom for 354 years.</p>
										
										<h6>Golden Mrauk – U</h6>
										<p align="justify">King Min Saw Mull founded Mrauk - U in A.D 1430. To make it last long for future generations he even risked his life. Against the counsel of Brahman astrologers and sages who predicted that " if His Majesty attemped to build Mrauk - U, the capital would last long but His Majesty's life be shortended", Min Saw Mun was unshaken in accomplishing his ambition. One of his sussessors King Min Bar Gyi (A.D 1531 - 1553) further strengthened, extended and modernized Mrauk - U . Diplomatic relations with Portugal and Holland were opend and trade with the Portuguese the Dutch and the Spanish prospered. Foreign visitors of that time remarked in their account that "Mrauk - U is like Amsterdam and London, one of the rich and thriving commercial seaport cities in South - east Asia."<br/>
										King Min Bar Gyi was a very cautious king who paid special attention to the security and defence of his Kingdom. Ancient city Mrauk - U, as it stands to day testifies to it. He could assess and utilize for defence purpose the strengths and weaknesses of the geographical location and natural environment of his domains. As the Kingdom occupied a narrow coastal strip with the sea front and being Criss- crossed by several rivers and streams, these physical features were put to use for building security and defence. Most ancient cities in Myanmar have normally three kinds of moat, Shunt Kyon, Nyun Kyon and Kyon Chauk defending them. But in the case of MraukU*, there were two more moats namely Kyon Shin and Kyon Pinlei, in addition to the usual three. So Mrauk - U was unique in defence system for it was defended with 5 moats. Mrauk - U is situated within the sea coast. It is surrounded by natural water system. Rivers and streams are fed and activated by the ebb and flow of the tide. For defence purpose, some of natural waters were drained off and land- filled, some were widened and extended yet some were deepened so that water flow could be regulated to form Kyon Shin to obstruct the invaders.<br/>
										The unique characteristics of the topography of Mrauk - U is that tiers of hills and mountains running around it. Between them are natural passes through which access is easy. These natural passes were fenced with earthen walls and stone walls thus forming a long line of defence walls aligned with hills and mountains. Between hills and mountains where it was locationally favourable, big dams and reservoirs were built to store water as well as to serve as water barrier (Kyon Pinlei). Water gates and sluices were installed systematically so that water could be regulated to supply for public consumption and to rush it out to repulse the invaders. Even to - day Mrauk - U municipality enjoys the benefit of the water storage syatem of old days. We cannot help but utter words of admiration and appreciation and express thanks to King Minbin of golden period of Mrauk - U for his farsightedness and ingenuity in town planning and defence system for future generations to enjoy welfare and security.<br/>
										All along the hills and mountain ranges where there were strategic points and main entries and exists of rivers and streams, were built fortresses into the natural surrounding. At present " Kyaung Lei Don" Fortress of stone in its original condition can be witnessed to the north - east of " Ko Thaung Pahto Daw Gyi Pagoda". King Minbin who made security and defence top priority in his national policy even turned to occult science for reassurance. Two of his guru monks Venerable Shin Mya Wa and Venerable Maha Pyannyar Kyaw who were expert in vedas, astrology, charm and cabalistic diagram were consulted. Under their instruction and supervision , a hundred large fences and a thousand small fences with cabalistic diagrams affixed to them were installed on the summits of hill and mountains ranges around Mrauk - U. These mystic fences the two monks arranged were believed to have potent supernatural power to ward off the enemies. Many caves and pagodas were built near them.<br/>
										After the security and defence system was established naturally, artificially and supernaturally, King Minbin did his best in food storage for his subjects in normal time as well as in emergency. Special sites were chosen to build granaries. Historical records tell us that there were 41 big granaries at Mrauk - U alone.<br/>
										Right now archaeologists have discovered and compiled an inventory of 13 granaries. It is expected more will be found. Of the 13 granaries, Win Ma Na Granary is now being preserved by Archaeology Department, Mrauk - U Branch.<br/>
										City gates that provided entry into the city were built in accordance with their strategic importance. They are strong gates built of stone. Water gates and sluices built of the same material are in good condition till to - day. Contemporary of Kings Tabin Shwe Hti and Bayint Naung of Taungoo and Hamsavadi respectively, King Minbin ranked equal to them in that he provided strong security and defence, and sufficient food storage to his people. His Kingdom was a modern and developed Kingdom of that time. He left strong united, consolidated prosperous and progressive Kingdom for generation of 48 successor kings after him who ruled and regined for 354 Years. Mrauk - U is the only site in Myanmar where there is as assemblage of many stone buildings.<br/>
										A model of Mrauk - U with detail of its natural and man - made barriers and defence walls, city walls, moats, city gates, water gates, granaries, ets will be displayed for public at Mrauk - U Archaeological Museum so as to stimulate interest of local and foreign visitors.</p>

Shit-thoung main Ceti and surrounding small ceties were built on massive stone platform which is 12 feet high. The main image hall is at the centre of the shrine. The main ceti is surrounded by twenty-six smaller ceties. Shitthoung temple is 160 feet in length 124 in breadth and 86 feet in height. There are three passage ways inside the temple. The inner-most passage way is accessable from the second inner passage way. Stone Buddha images are placed inside the niches along the inner most passage way. Besides, the previous lives of the Buddha are depicted in the form of birds, animals and Jataka stories. The total number of stone figures in relief is more than: one thousand. Moreover, the stone figures of Indra, Brahma devas, Kings, Wasonederay, Kanneras are also found inside the temple, This temple is called Shitthoung Temple meaning more than 80000 Buddha images and relics were enshrined in this temple. Among the stone carvings the most interesting carvings'' are the figures of dancing, wrestling and practising martial arts.</p>

										<h6>Htokekant Theim Temple</h6>
										<p align="justify">Htoke kant Theim temple was built by King Min Phaloung in 1571 AD. It is located about 200 yards to the west of Shit-thoung temple. A small mound was levelled to about 20 feet and Htokekant Theim was built on it. One can reach to Htoke-kant Theim by ascending eighteen steps of stone stairs. Htokekant Theim is in fact an ordination hall (Sima) which was surmounted by a large stupa and surrounded by four small corner stupas. The plan of Htake-kant Theim resembles that of Shitthoung temple. The lower structure (the main temple) which is 110 feet from north to south and 137 feet from east to west, was built of stone while the upper main stupa and corner stupas were built of bricks. The western side of the ordination hall is circular in shape. (see plan) A Sabbath hall is attached to the ordination hall at south-western side. The height from floor level to the top of the stupa is 64 feet. There are many stone Buddha images inside the niches along the interior passage way of Htoke kant Theim temple. Many stone carvings of worshipping couples, royal families, and ministers were also depicted on both side of the niches. The stone carvings inside this temple are historically important because the visitors can study ancient MuaukU period costumes, ornaments and hair-knotting style and ladies headdresses.</p>

										<h6>Ratanapon Ceti</h6>
										<p align="justify">Ratanapon ceti was built by King Min Khamoung and queen Shin Htwe in AD 1612.The bell-shaped dome is resting on three receding terraces.

Forty eight kings ruled over Mrauk-U Kingdom for 354 years.The golden age of Mrauk-U came to an end in AD 1784 at the time of King Maha-thar-nataRazar. Pious Buddhist Kings starting from King Min Saw Mon, royal queens, ministers and royal families built many stupas and temples around Nlr.-ILII -U Kingdom. The inventory list of ancient Buddist edifices shows that there are 157 ancient religious monuments around Mrauk-U. Majority of ancient religious monuments except a few were built of stone. Many stupas and temples were ruined by heavy rain, or by bombing during the Second World War. Similarly many stupas and temples were destroyed by treasure hunters who are in search of antiquities and valueable jewellery. Therefore many stupas and temples were in the poor state of deterioration and many monuments were covered by bushes vegetation and trees for many years. The Department of Archaeology could take necessary measures of conservation on a limited number of historic monuments due to budget constraint.<br/>	
										In 1995, Prime Minister Senior General Than Shwe the Chairman of the State Peace and Development Council visited Mrauk-U ancient monuments. After visiting Muauk-U Prime Minister Senior-General Than Shwe gave necessary instructions to preserve and restore the ruined Buddhist ancient monuments which are covered with bushes and trees. Senior General Than Shwe also allotted kyats 10000000/- budget every year for the restoration of ruined Buddhist monuments starting from budget year 1996-97 upto now. So far Department of Archaeology.,received total budget Kyats 104200000/- for the restoration and reconstruction of Mrauk-U ancient monuments.</p>

										<h5>Anandacanra Stone Inscription</h5>
										<p align="justify">The Original location of Anandacandra stone inscription was inside the Vesali ancient city (AD370). It was King Min Bar Gvi who transfered the Anandacandra anciention from it’s original place to Maruk-U in AD 1535 and set up at the left side of the main stairway of Shitthoung temple. Except the southern face; the other three faces bear inscription which were recorded by the kings who ruled at Vesali from 4th to 10th century A.D. The date of various inscriptions differed about two hundred years. Although the Sanskrit language was used throughout the inscription, the script used in this inscription are found to be Nagari scripts and proto-Bengali scripts, the origin of which is Brahmi script. The epigraphists accepted this iscription as a very rare stone inscription in the world. Whatever the scripts may be different, the grammer, the meaning and the consonant of the words are basically rooted in Pali (Magada) language. The literary standard of this inscription is very high because four kinds of verses were used in this inscription. It is aslo known that the culture based on Buddhism has flourished in Vesali. Moreover it was very rich in vocabulary. Although the dynasty of kings were recorded in Indian epigraphy, no regnai eers were recorded. Therefore, India epigraphist Dr D.0 Sircar remarked that this was the earliest among the stone scriptions recorded the regnai years, ever found in Asia region.<br/>
										As an evidence of the flourishness of Buddhist culture, the richness of vpcalbualry and the development of writing; one can read the following extract from Anandacandra inscription.</p>
										<p align="justify">Verse (stanza) No. 21<br/>
										………… :” Tena Nippa dya nagaran swegga sondaya harsinam pansapan saga dobhdani etas razan yatha swina”………..<br/>
										………… " Having built a city which is more beautiful and splendid than the city of celestial beings as if mocking the latter city, the famous king ruled for 55 years” ......</p>
										<p align="justify">Verse (stanza) No. 53<br/>
										………...Lohapatra nya nekani sanne tra civaranica nanadega gatanca bikhuna goravadda do<br/>
										………."The King with profound devotion donated the bronze thabeik (aim bowls) and very fine silk robes to the monks coming from eight Dithas (directions)………..”</p>
										<p align="justify">Verse (stanza) No. 44<br/>
										……….." Yasatatusa tan pranata bupati morlimala ratana dyuti prasare ranzita parda padma Anadacandra buwaneka yagortitunga Anandayan zayati werita movibuma" ………	<br/>
										………." The son of that king is very famous. The palm like the lotus with decorated portion on the throne is shinning by the brightness of gold and gems from the golden headresses of the bowing kings. The King Anandacandra has good reputation on the world and he was a beloved king of the people. He destroyed the darkness - like enemy. He was very powerful………..”</p>
										<h6>Mrauk-U</h6>
										<p align="justify">One of the best archaeological site as attraction is situated in Yakhine State, on the South-Western part of Myanmar. The ancient capital founded by Rakkhine King Minsawmon in 1433 AD.. Mrauk U period flourished between 15th century and 18th century. The city is 80 km from the north of Sittwe, port city once known as the Golden Gate by the west. The early 17th century was Rakhine's Golden Age for it's trading with western countries such as Holland, Spain, Portugal, Maldives, Italy and south India. The temples and Pagodas are strategically located on the hilltops and look like fortresses. There are many countless Images spreading all over with some are in ruins and influenced by Indian culture and civilization. Shitthaung Pagoda, Kothaung Pagoda, Anndawthein, Laungbonpyauk, Dukkhanthein, and Pitaakataik are famous ancient Temples with countless stupas. About 8km from Mrauk-U is Ve'Sali, an archeological zone from 4th century. This ancient city is earlier than Mrauk-U period. Ve'Sali was succeeded by a series of small cities although Mrauk-U remained.</p>
