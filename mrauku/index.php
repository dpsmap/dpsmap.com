Lemro kings built one city after another and ruled for 600 years. Because of the changes of the river course and erosion, all the city walls and structural remains were no more in existence. Besides, religious buildings and palatial buidings were destroyed and wiped out by river erosion. Therefore substantial structural remains of Lemro period were. all lost from our sight. A few remaining stupas were also renovated or rebuilt in modern times.</p>

After ascending the throne, he founded a new city Laung-Kyet. Since bad omen and misfortune fell on the city of Laung-Kyet, the king founded another new city Purain and six kings ruled for twenty years upto the reign of King Kawliya AD 1123.</p>
                </br>

                <p>King Alaw-mar phyu who ascended the throne in AD 1250 moved the capital city from Narinsayar to Laung-kyet on the other side of Lemro river. Eighteen kings starting from King Alawmar-phyu to King Min Saw Mon ruled at Laung-kyet city for 155 years. In AD 1406 King Min Ye Kyaw~ Swar of Inwa (Ava) Kingdom attacked Laung-kyet city. Therefore King Min Saw Mon fled to Bengal and stayed there for twenty two years. King Min-Htee is the longest-living and the most prominent king who ruled at Laung-kyet city.</p>
               
                </br>
                <h3>Laung-kyet Toung Maw Inscription</h3>
                <p>Laung-kyet hill is located five miles to the east of Mrauk-U town. In AD 1123 King Kawliya recorded about his meritorious deeds by inscribing on the surface of natural rocks. The large rock measures 65 feet in length, 20 feet in height and 4 feet in thickness. In this inscription king Kawliya mentioned about the objects which he donated such as mats, pots, slaves; etc. The king also mentioned about his restoration works of ruined monasteries and construction of 7760 Buddhist stupas. He proclaimed himself as an incompareable donor who is very generous in donating.</p>
                <p>Although Lemro period (AD 818—AD 1430) cultural heritage monuments are not in existence nowadays, a considerable number of bronze Buddha images were collected by the Department of Archaeology from the ruined stupas since pre-war days.

Apart from natural mountain ranges, massive stone fortification walls were built to defend from the danger of military campaign from their rival Kingdoms. The view of Mrauk-U city as seen from above with the surrounding mountain ranges and encircling canals and moats makes the visitors spellbound. Mrauk-U city can be said as the strongest fortress city built in 1511, century A.D as evidenced by the remains of massive stone fortification walls and gate ways.</p>
                <p>Mrauk - U which remained as the capital of Rakhine Kingdom, was founded by King Min Saw Mori in AD 1430 . There were three Mrauk- U dynastic period. First Mrauk - U dynasty started with Min Saw Mon ( AD 1430-1433 ) and ended with Min Khaung Razar (AD 1521-1531 ). Twelve Kings ruled over the First Mrauk - U dynastic period. The Second Mrauk - U dynasty was started with King Min Bar Gyi (AD 1531-1553 ) and ended with King Min Sanai ( AD 1638, 20 days) . Nine Kings of the Second Mrauk - U dynasty ruled at Mrauk - U Kingdom. The third or the last Mrauk - U dynasty was ruled by twenty-seven Kings starting from King Kuthala - Narapatigyi ( AD 1638-1645 ) to King Mahathamada Razar ( AD 1782-1784 ) Altogether 48 Kings ruled over Mrauk - U Kingdom for 354 years.</p>

                <h3>Golden Mrauk – U</h3>
                <p>King Min Saw Mull founded Mrauk - U in A.D 1430. To make it last long for future generations he even risked his life. Against the counsel of Brahman astrologers and sages who predicted that " if His Majesty attemped to build Mrauk - U, the capital would last long but His Majesty's life be shortended", Min Saw Mun was unshaken in accomplishing his ambition. One of his sussessors King Min Bar Gyi (A.D 1531 - 1553) further strengthened, extended and modernized Mrauk - U . Diplomatic relations with Portugal and Holland were opend and trade with the Portuguese the Dutch and the Spanish prospered. Foreign visitors of that time remarked in their account that "Mrauk - U is like Amsterdam and London, one of the rich and thriving commercial seaport cities in South - east Asia."</p>
                <p>King Min Bar Gyi was a very cautious king who paid special attention to the security and defence of his Kingdom. Ancient city Mrauk - U, as it stands to day testifies to it. He could assess and utilize for defence purpose the strengths and weaknesses of the geographical location and natural environment of his domains. As the Kingdom occupied a narrow coastal strip with the sea front and being Criss- crossed by several rivers and streams, these physical features were put to use for building security and defence. Most ancient cities in Myanmar have normally three kinds of moat, Shunt Kyon, Nyun Kyon and Kyon Chauk defending them. But in the case of MraukU*, there were two more moats namely Kyon Shin and Kyon Pinlei, in addition to the usual three. So Mrauk - U was unique in defence system for it was defended with 5 moats. Mrauk - U is situated within the sea coast. It is surrounded by natural water system. Rivers and streams are fed and activated by the ebb and flow of the tide. For defence purpose, some of natural waters were drained off and land- filled, some were widened and extended yet some were deepened so that water flow could be regulated to form Kyon Shin to obstruct the invaders.</p>
                <p>The unique characteristics of the topography of Mrauk - U is that tiers of hills and mountains running around it. Between them are natural passes through which access is easy. These natural passes were fenced with earthen walls and stone walls thus forming a long line of defence walls aligned with hills and mountains. Between hills and mountains where it was locationally favourable, big dams and reservoirs were built to store water as well as to serve as water barrier (Kyon Pinlei). Water gates and sluices were installed systematically so that water could be regulated to supply for public consumption and to rush it out to repulse the invaders. Even to - day Mrauk - U municipality enjoys the benefit of the water storage syatem of old days. We cannot help but utter words of admiration and appreciation and express thanks to King Minbin of golden period of Mrauk - U for his farsightedness and ingenuity in town planning and defence system for future generations to enjoy welfare and security.</p>
                <p>All along the hills and mountain ranges where there were strategic points and main entries and exists of rivers and streams, were built fortresses into the natural surrounding. At present " Kyaung Lei Don" Fortress of stone in its original condition can be witnessed to the north - east of " Ko Thaung Pahto Daw Gyi Pagoda". King Minbin who made security and defence top priority in his national policy even turned to occult science for reassurance. Two of his guru monks Venerable Shin Mya Wa and Venerable Maha Pyannyar Kyaw who were expert in vedas, astrology, charm and cabalistic diagram were consulted. Under their instruction and supervision , a hundred large fences and a thousand small fences with cabalistic diagrams affixed to them were installed on the summits of hill and mountains ranges around Mrauk - U. These mystic fences the two monks arranged were believed to have potent supernatural power to ward off the enemies. Many caves and pagodas were built near them.</p>
                <p>After the security and defence system was established naturally, artificially and supernaturally, King Minbin did his best in food storage for his subjects in normal time as well as in emergency. Special sites were chosen to build granaries. Historical records tell us that there were 41 big granaries at Mrauk - U alone.</p>
                <p>Right now archaeologists have discovered and compiled an inventory of 13 granaries. It is expected more will be found. Of the 13 granaries, Win Ma Na Granary is now being preserved by Archaeology Department, Mrauk - U Branch.</p>
                <p>City gates that provided entry into the city were built in accordance with their strategic importance. They are strong gates built of stone. Water gates and sluices built of the same material are in good condition till to - day. Contemporary of Kings Tabin Shwe Hti and Bayint Naung of Taungoo and Hamsavadi respectively, King Minbin ranked equal to them in that he provided strong security and defence, and sufficient food storage to his people. His Kingdom was a modern and developed Kingdom of that time. He left strong united, consolidated prosperous and progressive Kingdom for generation of 48 successor kings after him who ruled and regined for 354 Years. Mrauk - U is the only site in Myanmar where there is as assemblage of many stone buildings.</p>
                <p>A model of Mrauk - U with detail of its natural and man - made barriers and defence walls, city walls, moats, city gates, water gates, granaries, ets will be displayed for public at Mrauk - U Archaeological Museum so as to stimulate interest of local and foreign visitors.</p>

                <h3>Fortresses</h3>
                <p>Fortresses were built on the city walls of Mrauk - U . They were built of stone blocks on the mountain ranges in alignment with natural features of the ranges. Within the fortresses, there were flights of stone steps for the warriors to come up .</p>
                <p>When enemies approached, all defence forces could be immediately alerted by pulling the chains attached to the bells to ring. These bells were installed hidden in the mouths of big lion statues.</p>

Pious Buddhist Kings starting from King Min Saw Mon, royal queens, ministers and royal families built many stupas and temples around Nlr.-ILII -U Kingdom. The inventory list of ancient Buddist edifices shows that there are 157 ancient religious monuments around Mrauk-U. Majority of ancient religious monuments except a few were built of stone. Many stupas and temples were ruined by heavy rain, or by bombing during the Second World War. Similarly many stupas and temples were destroyed by treasure hunters who are in search of antiquities and valueable jewellery. Therefore many stupas and temples were in the poor state of deterioration and many monuments were covered by bushes vegetation and trees for many years. The Department of Archaeology could take necessary measures of conservation on a limited number of historic monuments due to budget constraint.</p>
                <p>In 1995, Prime Minister Senior General Than Shwe the Chairman of the State Peace and Development Council visited Mrauk-U ancient monuments. After visiting Muauk-U Prime Minister Senior-General Than Shwe gave necessary instructions to preserve and restore the ruined Buddhist ancient monuments which are covered with bushes and trees. Senior General Than Shwe also allotted kyats 10000000/- budget every year for the restoration of ruined Buddhist monuments starting from budget year 1996-97 upto now. So far Department of Archaeology.,received total budget Kyats 104200000/- for the restoration and reconstruction of Mrauk-U ancient monuments.</p>
